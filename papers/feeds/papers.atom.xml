funds (i.e. resources that can only be spent on specific products) on
consumers' budgeting decisions. Using a policy-relevant example, we find
that consumers endowed with a food-restricted resource (akin to food
stamps) budget a smaller amount to food than consumers endowed with an
unrestricted resource.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1 id="1-manifest"&gt;1. Manifest&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Process Macro by Andrew F. Hayes has helped thousands of researchers
in their analysis of moderation, mediation, and conditional processes.
Unfortunately, Process was only available for proprietary softwares
(SAS and SPSS), which means that students and researchers had to
purchase a license of those softwares to make use of the Macro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the growing popularity of Python in the scientific community,
I decided to implement the features of the Process Macro into an
open-source library, that researchers will be able to use without
relying on proprietary softwares. PyProcess&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
